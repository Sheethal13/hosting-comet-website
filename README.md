# hosting-comet-website
I have built a *multiple-paged website* based on simple details related with the comets. This is a simple website made using **only HTML and CSS**, no javascript is used. Also no snippets are included. Complexities are avoided to my maximum and I have tried to keep it rather simple both from the sight of creation and understanding.

## Mission behind creating

The actual goal behind this project is to learn how to develop a website by oneself using HTML and CSS. This *multiple-paged website* has been created as part of our final task on **website development using HTML and CSS**.

## Extend of usefulness

This project shows the possibility of building a website using the very simple and basic HTML knowledge and helps to understand how small changes(in the markup language) make large differences(in the preview). I have included styling for a responsive gallery section in the CSS file but as a comment and this can be **so** used if required. I have also added the copyright logo in the website home page by using `&copy` in the HTML file. 

In short there are 4 webpages created using 4 different HTML files and a single CSS file. *ie,* only a single stylesheet is enough for styling a website with the same layout throughout its various pages. Here, the header layout includes navigation bar first and then the page-heading with a background image. Then comes the body layout divied into a section with article part and aside part and a footer section, in the case of home page, features page and gallery page. While in FAQs page the body is divided into a single section, with a box included for the queries and answers, and a footer, with textbox for sending their queries. In the home page a youtube video is embedded and also a form with labels for name and email is included for contacting. Apart from these, I have also mentioned the sites used as the reference for the details incorporated in the pages. In the gallery page, images are embedded along with their written description, and also links to major websites are added in the footer section.
